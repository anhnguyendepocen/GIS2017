## Using the DHS to complement other analyses
The [Demographic and Health Surveys](https://dhsprogram.com/) collect large household level surveys roughly every four years, depending on the country.  While the majority of the data is centered around health statistics, there is also other cross-sectoral information about things like education, land holdings, water, sanitation and hygiene, etc.  Additionally, the DHS has invested in sharing the data publicly and making it easy to incorporate into other work.  Here are the major ways they do so:

1. Stat Compiler
2. Shapefiles of countries and indicators
3. Modelled surfaces of key indicators
4. Raw and processed data for household surveys
5. Contextual indicators at survey clusters
