## Using the DHS to complement other analyses
The [Demographic and Health Surveys](https://dhsprogram.com/) collect large household level surveys roughly every four years, depending on the country.  While the majority of the data is centered around health statistics, there is also other cross-sectoral information about things like education, land holdings, water, sanitation and hygiene, etc.  Additionally, the DHS has invested in sharing the data publicly and making it easy to incorporate into other work.  Here are the major ways they do so:

### 1. [Stat Compiler](https://www.statcompiler.com/en/)
* Visualize any indicator in the DHS in a table, map, or graph.
* Can select data for a particular country or countries.
* Can also download the data as a .csv or countries.
* Data can be disaggregated to the Administrative 1 level, or by region (urban/rural), sex, age, or asset index quntiles, where appropriate.

### 2. Shapefiles of countries and indicators

### 3. [Modelled surfaces of key indicators](http://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/modeled-surfaces/)
* Each map package contains a mean estimation surface and an uncertainty surfaces
* Can use the two surfaces to mask areas of high uncertainty (see page 41 [here](https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/SAR14/SAR14.pdf))
* Modeled surfaced have a 5 X 5 kilometer resolution
* Things to watch out for:
  * Not good for urban areas
  * Seasonal or temporal limitations
* What should you use them for? Monitoring and evaluation specific tasks or program planning
  * Advocate for program support (identify areas of greatest need)
  * Compare program intervention areas to non-intervention areas
  * Aggregate to higher level administrative zones (Feed the Future Zones of Influence or FEWS Net Livelihood zones)

### 4. [Raw and processed data for household surveys](https://dhsprogram.com/data/)
* Data on population, health, nutrition, HIV and for over 90 countries
* Allow for more advanced analysis, such as regression analysis (What factors are correlated with stunting in [Niger](https://dhsprogram.com/what-we-do/survey/survey-display-407.cfm)?)
* Highly standardized and structured -- slight learning curve, but once you learn how to work with the data you are good to go.
* Regularly updated and trusted



### 5. Contextual indicators at survey clusters
